# Machine-Learning-Practice-1
Practice Machine Learning with Multiple Linear Regression

## **Analyze diamonds dataset**

     - Carat, depth, table, x, y, z as numerical independent variable
     - Cut, color, clarity as categorical independent variable
     - Price as dependent variable

## - Analyze the relationship
## - Apply Multiple Linear Regression with dummy variable
## - Perform Simultant Test and Partial Test
## - Check the assumptions
## - Interpret the result
## - Use Î± 5%

**Try to find the best model without any multicollinearity, or at least the least one.**
